          <h3>Education</h3>
          <h4>General Assembly, Web Development Immersive</h4>
          <p>
            "Always be coding" - our mantra for the 12-week, full-time program
            where my cohort and I learned computational thinking and practiced
            building modern, full-stack web applications.
          </p>
          <h4>University of Minnesota, B.A. Advertising</h4>
          <p>
            My coursework in advertising trained me to think about products and
            experiences from a customer perspective. Along with foundational
            skills in marketing, visual communication, and strategic thinking, I
            learned to work effectively with a multidisiplinary team of strong
            and varied personalities.

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <h4>Product Manager</h4>
          <p>
            As a e-commerce product manager, I focused on identifying
            opportunities and implementing features to help customers find
            products. This role introduced me to the world of web development
            and gave me the opportunity to follow my curiosity about how web
            sites work.
          </p>
          <h4>Business Analyst</h4>
          <p>
            A bridge between business and technology, I helped tech leaders
            understand the business needs, and business managers understand what
            solutions and timelines were reasonable. I managed multiple new and
            ongoing web products for e-commerce and health care. I also became
            responsible for implementing accessibility standards, which sparked
            a great interest in developing web sites that are accessible to all
            users.
